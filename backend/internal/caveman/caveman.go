// Package caveman implements output-token compression by injecting a terse
// "caveman speak" instruction into the request's system prompt.
//
// It is a faithful Go port of 9router's caveman injector, which itself adapts
// the caveman skill (https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman). The model is
// instructed to keep all technical substance exact while dropping articles,
// filler, hedging, and pleasantries — cutting roughly 65-75% of output tokens
// without losing meaning.
//
// Like terse mode, this is a request-side transform that only touches the
// system prompt and runs before format translation, so it applies uniformly
// across every provider dialect.
