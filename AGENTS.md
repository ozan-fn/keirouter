**295** " 🔵 **KeiRouter Store Layer Architecture**
The primary session is exploring the KeiRouter backend's persistence layer to understand the existing budget feature before implementing token/credit usage-based budget limits. The store package in backend/internal/store/ provides a clean repository pattern with dialect-aware SQL, supporting both SQLite for local/single-binary usage and Postgres for team/VPS deployments. The repo_budgets.go file already exists as a typed repository, indicating the budget feature has an established persistence layer that will need to be extended.

**296** 11:00p 🔵 **KeiRouter Backend Project Structure**
The primary session is mapping the KeiRouter backend codebase structure before implementing token/credit-based budget limits. The project is a comprehensive API gateway/router with a well-organized internal package structure. Key modules relevant to the budget enhancement include: budget/budget.go (core budget logic), store/repo_budgets.go (budget persistence), store/repo_usage.go (usage data), meter/meter.go (metering), and usagehub/hub.go (usage aggregation). The existing usage tracking infrastructure suggests the project already tracks token/credit consumption, which will be leveraged for the new budget limit dimensions.

**297** 11:01p 🔵 **KeiRouter Has Significant Uncommitted Changes on Main**
The primary session discovered that the KeiRouter project on the main branch already has substantial uncommitted work — 32 files with nearly 1,400 lines added. This existing work touches the pipeline, connectors, gateway, store, meter, and frontend, suggesting significant in-progress development before the current budget feature request. The changes span the full stack from API gateway handling through connector integrations to the React frontend's Usage, Quota, and Keys pages. The budget/token limit feature will be built on top of these existing modifications.

**298** 11:02p 🔵 **KeiRouter Budget System Currently USD-Only**
The primary session discovered that the current budget system in KeiRouter is entirely USD-based. The budgets table stores limits as limit_micros (micro-USD), and the SpendSince() method only aggregates cost_micros. However, usage_records already captures detailed token data (prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, cached_tokens, cache_write_tokens) per request, providing the raw data needed to implement token-based budget limits. The admin gateway's create-key endpoint already supports atomic key+budget creation with hard cutoff, suggesting the same pattern should be extended for token/credit limits.
~346t -

**299** 11:03p 🔵 **Store Migrations Directory Located**
The primary session located the migrations directory at backend/internal/store/migrations/. This is where schema migrations are stored for adding new columns or tables — any new budget limit types (token-based, credit-based) will require a new migration file. The repo_budgets.go and repo_usage.go files were both modified today (June 3), suggesting active work on these areas.
