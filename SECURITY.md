## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| Latest `main` | Yes |
| Older commits | Best effort |

As KeiRouter is in active development and has not yet reached a stable release, we recommend always running the latest version from `main`.

## Scope

KeiRouter handles encrypted credentials and API keys. Areas of particular security interest include:

- Envelope encryption (`internal/crypto/`, `internal/vault/`)
- API key hashing and authentication (`internal/identity/`, `internal/auth/`)
- OAuth token storage and refresh (`internal/oauth/`)
- Admin API access controls (`internal/gateway/`)

We appreciate your help in keeping KeiRouter secure.
